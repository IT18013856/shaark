# Laravel Shaarli

**Laravel Shaarli is a self-hosted platform to keep and share your content: web links, posts, passwords and pictures.**

All of your data can be **private, public or both** and can be browsed by **tags** or **all-in-one search**.

**Laravel Shaarli** is production ready, inspired by [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli) 
and built with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Contribute

### Features and bugs

All contributions are welcome! Please use the `dev` branch for your pull requests.  
If you make changes to JS, don't compile assets in production, I'll manually compile them when merging for security reasons.

### Translation

Shaarli is actually available in **English**, **French** and **German**. Feel free to make a pull request to add or update a localization. 
You can see laravel base localizations [on this repo](https://github.com/caouecs/Laravel-lang).

### Your Shaarli

You host your own Shaarli public instance and you want to share it with other Shaarliers? 
You can make a pull request to add it to our public listing located at [shaarlies.md](https://github.com/MarceauKa/laravel-shaarli/blob/dev/shaarlies.md). 

## Security

If you find any **security issues**, please send me an email (can be found in composer.json).

### Global privacy

If you don't want your content being publicy accessible, you can update this preference once application is installed from settings section.

### 2-FA

You're able to active 2-FA (2 factors authentication). By default 2-FA is disabled but you can update it from your app settings. 
Code length and code expiration are also configurable. **Test if you application can send emails before enabling this feature**.

### Auth monitoring

Shaarli logs all successful and failed auths with their associated devices.

### Chests encryption

Since `1.2.9`, all chests data are encrypted in your database using AES-256-CBC and your app key.

### Multi-users

Others users can be admin or non-admin. Admin users are like the main user and have an access to the entire content. 
Non-admin users can't access the settings section and can only see their own private content.
